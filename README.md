# Flowgraph-C
Created a flowgraph of all the functions called during the execution of a C program. Includes User defined functions, Library functions, System calls. Helpful in visualising the step by step execution of a program. Uses python to trace the flow of the program through GDB. Uses RTL dumps to find the library functions and System calls.
